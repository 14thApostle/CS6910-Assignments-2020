**Question 1**

I relied on an automated script to run and test different models with different parameters and to record the results.
They are attached in the Q1 folder as
- max_pool.py
- n_conv_layers.py
- n_fc_layers.py
- n_filters.py
Also attached as testing.py is the basefile that I used to run further manual tests.

**Question 2**

2.1) The occlusion sensitivity code has been attached as occlusion_sens.py in Q2_1 folder

2.2) Filter Analysis

    2.2.1) The filter identification code for a particular layer has been attached as filter_identification.py. 
            The filter_ident.ipynb has the same code but with the values changed to get results for each of the 5 layers needed.
            
    2.2.2) The filter modification code for a particular layer has been attached as filter_modification.py
            The filter_modification.ipynb has the same code but with the values changed to get results for each of the 5 layers.
            

(Output has been cleared for the attached jupyter notebooks as they were around 15-60mb with the output images)
